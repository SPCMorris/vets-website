Servicemembers who have less than 120 days before they will be separated from the military must quickly complete the following procedures. 

- Contact your local Transition Assistance Program (TAP) manager to schedule and complete the mandatory Transition Goals, Plans, Success (GPS) curriculum. If you are unable to attend this training, it is available through [Joint Knowledge Online](https://jkodirect.jten.mil). You must complete the VA Benefits Briefings I and II, the Department of Labor Employment Workshop, and an Individual Transition Plan (ITP). ITPs are service specific, so check [documents](https://dodtap.mil/index.html) related to your branch. 
- Review [military transcripts](/employment/job-seekers/military-transcripts/) and service records for accuracy. 
- Think about which industries and careers interest you, using [tools](/employment/job-seekers/interest-profiler/) such as o*Net and CareerScope. 
- Start developing a résumé by [translating military skills] (/employment/job-seekers/federal-employment) into equivalent civilian skills. Import these using the [Résumé Builder](/employment/job-seekers/create-resume). 

- Complete the [Preseparation Counseling Checklist](http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/forms/eforms/dd2648t.pdf) (form DD2648).
- Compile your service-treatment records and military hospital reports if you plan on registering for VA medical resources.
Both of these documents can be ordered through the [National Archives]( https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/)
- Compile private medical records and hospital reports. 
- Finalize your résumé and begin actively [searching for employment](/employment/job-seekers/search_jobs).
- Consider taking one of three additional GPS tracks: Accessing Higher Education, Career Technical Training, or Entrepreneurship. 
- Consider free [education and career counseling](/education/tools-programs/education-career-counseling/)
- Begin applying for [federal jobs](/employment/job-seekers/federal-employment). 
- Attend networking and recruiting events.
- Review job boards, search job banks, and research openings at companies that interest you.
- Actively engage in your career search.
- Stop using military lingo like “V/R” in your career-search emails. 
- Wear professional, civilian clothing to events and in networking site photos.
-Complete TAP GPS.
-Prepare for final job interviews.

If you can’t find a job after you separate from active-duty service, you may be eligible for [unemployment benefits](/employment/job-seekers/unemployment-support/) through the Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers (UCX). You must apply for unemployment benefits in the state in which you reside. You can do this in person at your [state employment office](http://www.servicelocator.org/OWSLinks.asp) or, in some cases, online. Your state office will then determine if you are eligible, how much you may receive, and for how long. Unemployment benefits may vary from state to state.
