Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) provides special career assistance to Veterans and Servicemembers who are overcoming challenges associated with service-connected disabilities. For Veterans and Servicemembers with service-connected disabilities so severe that they cannot immediately consider work, VR&E offers services to improve their ability to live as independently as possible. Services may also be available to eligible family members.

### Are you eligible to apply for VR&E?

Yes, if:

- You are a Servicemember with a 20% or higher pre-discharge disability rating (memorandum rating) who will soon leave the military, or
- You are participating in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) process or awaiting discharge due to a medical condition resulting from a serious injury or illness that occurred in the line of duty, or
- You are a Veteran who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable and have a 10% or higher disability rating, and
- You separated from the military or received a service-connected disability rating from VA within the past 12 years.

*Note:* Veterans may be eligible for VR&E after 12 years if VA determines their employment handicap warrants an extension.
