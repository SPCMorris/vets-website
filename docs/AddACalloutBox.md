# Add a call out box

Adding a call out box to a Markdown document is easy. In most cases, you should use Markdown definition list syntax.

	Are you eligible for disability benefits?
	: Yes if:

    	-	You participated in Projects 112 or SHAD testing.
    	
	Who is covered
	: You and your survivors
	{:.va-callout}

Use the syntax found in [Adding Attributes](AddingAttributes.md) to add the `.va-callout` class to the end of the call out list.

The syntax here is very specfic.

- Answers / definitions should be left-aligned with the question or definition term and begin with `:`.
- There should be a single line break between the question or term and the answer
- Lists contained within the call out box must be preceded and followed by blank lines, and indented by 4 spaces.
