If you have received a decision notice with your disability rating, you may be eligible for additional compensation, education, health care, housing, employment, and dependent benefits.

### What happens after you get your disability rating?

#### Be sure you have received your decision notice from VA

If you haven’t received your decision notice, request to have it sent to you. Check your status on [eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/about/feature?feature=va-letters) or by contacting your [regional VA office](/facility-locator/).

#### Look for a payment within 15 days

If you have received a notice with at least a 10% rating decision, you will get either a direct-deposit payment or a check—depending on how you elected to be paid—within 15 days of your decision notice. If you don’t get a payment, please call the Veterans Help Line at 800-827-1000.

#### If you disagree with your disability rating, you may appeal

Within one year of receiving a decision notice with your rating, you may [file an appeal](/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/) to address any errors.

#### Be sure your dependents are registered with VA

If you are 30% or more service-connected disabled, you can receive additional payments and benefits for your dependents. Please use [eBenefits]( https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/about/feature?feature=dependent-compensation) or contact your local [eligibility office](/facility-locator/) to register your dependents with VA.

#### If you are 100% disabled, you may qualify for additional benefits

    - [Dental care](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/dentistry/)
    - [Commissary and exchange privileges](http://www.militaryonesource.mil/shopping?content_id=268500)

#### If you are not employable, you may qualify for additional benefits

If you are not employable due to your service-connected disability, even without a 100% rating, you can apply for [Individual Unemployability](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/individual-unemployability/).

#### If you require modified clothing because of your injuries, you may qualify for additional benefits

VA offers a [Clothing Allowance](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/clothing/) to eligible Veterans.


#### Apply for these additional benefits
- [VA health care](http://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apply/).
- Service-Disabled Veterans’ Insurance, a government life-insurance policy that is available if you are in good health other than your service-connected disabilities. Learn about [how to apply for S-DVI](/life-insurance/S-DVI) or call 1-800-669-8477.
- VA education benefits or additional education benefits under special programs. Learn about [education benefits](/education) or speak to a VA education counselor to find out what benefits are available to you.

#### Keep in touch
You must update VA when you have a new address, a change to your marital status, or any other life change that could affect your rating or payment. If your condition becomes worse, you may file a claim for an increase in benefits. Update your information through [eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/manage/documents) or by contacting your [local VA office or eligibility office](/facility-locator/).
